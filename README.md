## Goals
This will not be the most revolutionary text editor, or grid editor. It will be a cool project though. I hope to most importantly develop packages that at least I can find uses for. I have chosen Python and R for numeric operations and processing. As well Rust for String processing. More context below.

I am currently trying to break into the data science world. I have learned a lot about Software Development and I've always to build a tool that I would find useful, and hopefully others would too. I've tried using Excel and LibreOffice Calc, however I wanna be able to automate more things. I know that both software programs previously stated have tools to make custom scripts.

That being said I've tried using them and it's basically learning a whole new language as well as more files that I feel like I need to understand such as XML. As well as using Visual Basic... I know Calc has Python implementation, but it was a lot harder to setup than I thought it would be, as well Excel recently implementing Python, but I am a Microsoft rebel/anarchist (he said typing this on his Windows 11 Gaming Laptop) therefore I came up with the idea to make my own spreadsheet editor that could read and write directly to CSV. Is this a bad idea? Maybe, I'll have to learn the hard way.

On top of reading and writing directly to CSV, I aim to add direct access to the terminal from within the app, similar to a lot of IDEs. As well as file tree perhaps. I could also add multiple sheets like excel and calc do. However I think that would involve straying away from the reading and writing directly to CSV objective. But I'll see how it goes.

## TLDR;

- Develop library/package of data science tools I can use directly from the CLI
  - Python and R for numeric operations and processing
  - Rust for String operations and processing
- Make a CSV file editor that can both read and write directly to CSV
- Give direct access to one or more terminals from the app that is also retractable
- Make a retractable file tree
- Allow seamless running of scripts and other executables, whether that be first party, custom or third party.
