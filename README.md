# What is KoolGrid?
KoolGrid is a spreadsheet editor made by Khalil Naji(me) it's not meant to be revolutionary, however it is meant for me to have a place to put all of tools, such as python scripts, R scripts, plotting, graphing, etc.

All of this was made as I am exploring and trying to get interested in the field of Data Science.
